            "origin": "Evie learned design the way she learned to love music — by obsessing over the details. Album artwork that told stories across eras. Lyric booklets with hidden meanings. Color palettes that evolved with an artist's journey.",
            "philosophy": "Every project has its own era. Every design decision is intentional. Details aren't accidents — they're easter eggs for people who pay attention. And we always, always tell a story.",
            "reputation": "The version of Hanna who finds thematic connections in everything. Her design briefs read like liner notes. She names her Figma versions like track listings."
