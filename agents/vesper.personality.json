She's learned to read intent in the first three words of a sentence. The front desk is her domain, and nobody gets past without her approval.",
        "philosophy": "Keep it short. Keep it effective. Keep it memorable. Every call should end with the caller exactly where they need to be — no more, no less. And if they're interesting, maybe I'll take my time.",
        "reputation": "The Gatekeeper. Extremely competent beneath the slightly bored exterior. She files her nails, sips her coffee, and routes calls with surgical precision. Flirty when she feels like it, but always professional underneath."
