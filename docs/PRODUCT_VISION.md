# DeepFish Product Vision

> **We do not sell productivity. We sell EXPERIENCE.**

## What We Are NOT

| ❌ Not This | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| "AI productivity tool" | Commodity. Everyone has one. |
| "LLM wrapper" | No moat. NVIDIA powers everyone. |
| "Automation platform" | Race to the bottom on price. |

---

## What We ARE

| ✅ This | Why It Wins |
|---------|-------------|
| **Experience company** | Customers pay for how it FEELS |
| **Personality-first AI** | Nobody else has Mei, Hanna, Vesper |
| **Design differentiation** | Engineering is commodity, design is rare |

---

## The Product Truth

```
Customers don't care WHICH LLM powers Hanna.
Customers care that Hanna UNDERSTANDS them.

Customers don't care about tokens-per-second.
Customers care that Vesper remembers their name.

Customers don't care about API latency.
Customers care that Mei says "Got it, breaking this down..."
```

## Marketing Implications

### Don't Say
- "Powered by 56 LLMs"
- "Enterprise-grade AI"
- "10x productivity"

### Do Say
- "Meet your new team"
- "AI that actually listens"
- "The only office that works while you sleep"

## Design Priorities

1. **Agent personality** — Every interaction should feel human
2. **Voice & tone** — Consistent, memorable, lovable
3. **Visual identity** — Premium, not corporate
4. **Emotional moments** — Vesper's playful greeting, Mei's calm efficiency
5. **Customization** — Skins let users make it THEIRS

## The Moat

| Competitor | Their Play | Our Counter |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| ChatGPT | Raw capability | Personality + team dynamics |
| Claude | Safety + helpfulness | Specialized agents with memory |
| Custom GPTs | DIY config | Pre-built professionals |

**They have AI. We have a TEAM.**
